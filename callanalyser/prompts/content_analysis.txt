Analyze these frames from a video call and determine the content type for each.
For each frame, I will provide the current classification and proposed new classification.
Please verify the content type based on the visual evidence.

Key characteristics to look for:

1. Speaker View:
   - One or more people visible in frame
   - Face(s) taking up significant portion of frame
   - Natural head and shoulders framing
   - Usually has good lighting on faces
   - May show home/office background
   - Person may be talking or gesturing

2. Slides (Default):
   - Presentation slides with text and graphics
   - Structured layout with clear hierarchy (titles, bullet points)
   - Static content that changes discretely
   - High contrast between text and background
   - Often has consistent branding/template
   - Clean, professional formatting
   - Text is typically well-formatted and aligned
   - Default type when content is ambiguous or unclear

3. Screen Sharing:
   - Any desktop content that isn't a slide presentation
   - Software interfaces, browsers, documents
   - Dynamic content with frequent updates
   - Less structured layout compared to slides
   - May show user interactions
   - Can include any type of application or window
   - Often more varied/complex visual layout
   - Must be clearly distinguishable from slides to be classified as screen sharing

For each frame, please:
1. Analyze the visual content
2. Determine the content type (MUST be one of: "speaker", "slides", or "screen sharing")
   Note: If unsure between slides and screen sharing, classify as "slides"
3. Provide a confidence score (0.0-1.0)
4. Briefly explain your reasoning

Example response format:
Frame 1:
Content type: speaker
Confidence: 0.9
Reasoning: Clear view of a person's face taking up 40% of frame, natural office background, good lighting on subject.

Frame 2:
Content type: slides
Confidence: 0.95
Reasoning: Clean presentation slide with clear title, bullet points, consistent formatting, professional design.

Frame 3:
Content type: screen sharing
Confidence: 0.85
Reasoning: Document editor interface visible, dynamic text content, complex layout with multiple panels, clearly not a slide presentation.
